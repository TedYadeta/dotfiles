## Update: 08/09/25
This is a bit of a start towards something I am calling "DevEnvOps." I am not the first to implement something by this name (please see this Git [repository](https://github.com/JasonQSY/DevEnvOps) from 2017 or this [Medium](https://medium.com/@matthewcasperson/introducing-devenvops-26c35ee716bf) article, but there is a nice ring to it that I would like to provide a more formal definition.

## DevEnvOps

"DevEnvOps" or "Developer Environment Operations" is the art and practice of apply DevOps practices to the Developer's own workstation, the ultimate in applying "shift-left" to the entire process. By starting at the absolute left of the entire cycle, ensuring the proper practice of standardization across Operating Systems to Shells, one ensures a complete harmony from the beginning, and in turn, it echoes across the entire process.
