# vmsetup
My scripts for setting up VMs including downloading various language interpreters and compilers

Structure as follows:
install.sh

1. chkedit.sh - Check what editors are already installed on the system.
2. mklangdir.sh (Create the initial language folders, accounting for the ones already installed in the guest distro)
3. cpallrc.sh (Copy my .bash_aliases, .vimrc and .emacs/init.d file (Bonus points if we get put them in their respective files and symlink them.)
