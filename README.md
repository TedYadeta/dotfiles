# dotfiles
Default dotfiles and preferred settings for:

- bashrc
- bwm-ng
- cshrc
- git
- htop
- log (macOS command)
- nano
- PowerShell
- tmux
- vim
- simple scaffolding scripts for available OSes for quick environment setups
- basic Ansible playbooks for quick environment setups
- basic scripts for gathering system information

## NOTE: It is highly-advised to get the most of these scripts to run the respective scaffolding script for each OS (ex. win-scaffold.ps1, lnx-scaffold.sh, etc), as not having it may break things

## Update: 08/09/25
This is a bit of a start towards something I am calling "DevEnvOps." I am not the first to implement something by this name (please see this Git [repository](https://github.com/JasonQSY/DevEnvOps) from 2017 or this [Medium](https://medium.com/@matthewcasperson/introducing-devenvops-26c35ee716bf) article, but there is a nice ring to it that I would like to provide a more formal definition, which is added below.

## DevEnvOps

"DevEnvOps" or "Development Environment Operations" is the art and practice of applying DevOps practices to the Developer's own workstation, the ultimate in applying "shift-left" to the entire process. By starting at the absolute left of the entire cycle, ensuring the proper practice of standardization from the Shell, to Applications and Editors, to Operating Systems, one ensures complete harmony from the beginning, and in turn, it echoes across the entire environment.


## Update: 10/25/25
With the new addition of scripts including Python, Perl and potentially a few others, I am now adding quick scripts and other potential applications to help and assist in programming, scripting and automation. Because I might be effectively writing the same scripts over and over (in the attempted spirit of the Unix Philosophy), these "Polyglotfiles" will act as both useful applications and gentle introductions to a variety of languages in specific environments.

## Polyglotfiles

A portmanteau of "Polyglot" and "Dotfiles", these specific scripts and files are meant to ensure similar functionality across several languages, and OSes, serving as useful tools that double as learning exercises, showcasing the use of languages.

## Update: 01/29/26
With the expansion of my dotfiles/polyglotfiles into a massive sprawl across 4 Operating Systems, the introduction of LLM Modelfiles for OS Specialists and assistants, and to the point of writing custom applications, this has blossomed into something much larger, and I am excited for it. More to follow.
